# The Path to Multi GPU Systems

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a powerful decision making framework and modern applications can be extremely large with respect to the size of the state and action spaces. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) can improve algorithms efficiency by introducing parallel computation capabilities. Furthermore, there has been significant recent progress in developing methods for systems with multiple GPUs which enhance the memory size and computational performance. We develop a novel method and investigate the performance of using multi-GPU systems to solve MDPs through Value Iteration. We compare the performance to both single GPU systems and CPU-only systems.
