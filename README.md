# The Path to Multi GPU Systems
In this project you need to parallelize applications using mutlti-GPU systems and compare the performance with a single GPU. Based on this, you need to analyze the results, using profiling tools for CUDA and, based on this analysis, build an analytical model that can predict whether it is better to use single GPU or multi-GPU systems. You need to determing:<br />

    What are the inputs to that model? 
    What is the model itself? 
    What is the accuracy of the model?
